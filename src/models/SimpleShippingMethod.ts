 * # Inland waterways
 *
 * Vessel sizes:
 * * `inland_waterway_motor_vessel_*`:
 * * `extra_small` – less than 50 m / 650 t
 * * `small` – 50-80 m (650-1000 t)
 * * `medium` – 85-110 m (1000-2000 t)
 * * `large` – 135 m (2000-3000 t)
 * * `inland_waterway_coupled_convoy` – 163-185 m
 * * `inland_waterway_pushed_convoy_*`:
 * * `small` – 2 barges
 * * `medium` – 4-5 barges
 * * `large` – 6 barges
 * * `inland_waterway_container_vessel_medium` – 110 m
 * * `inland_waterway_container_vessel_large` – 135 m
 *
 * # Road transport
 *
 * As far as road transport is concerned we support a variety of trucks (the `truck_*`
 * methods). Our emission estimates assume diesel fuel and average load characteristics
 * at the moment, unless a specific type says otherwise.
 *
 * ## Regional differences
 *
 * Truck types in North America and the rest of the world are categorized differently,
 * therefore they're available here as distinct shipping methods. The North America
 * trucks are prefixed with `truck_na_` while for the rest of the world it's just `truck_`.
 *
 * ## Truck sizes
 *
 * * Vans (`truck_generic_van`, `truck_na_van`) are under 3.5 tonnes GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight).
 * * `truck_generic_urban` is between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes GVW
 * * `truck_generic_mgv` is betwen 7.5 and 20 tonnes
 * * `truck_generic_hgv` is above 20 tonnes GVW
 *
 * For other truck types the GVW is either in the method name (like `truck_rigid_7_5t` which is
 * up to 7.5 tonnes) or is not specified.
 *
 * ## Choosing the right truck type
 *
 * The are significant differences in emissions of different truck types. The more precisely
 * you can declare what kind of truck you use, the better.
 *
 * If you only know a rough size of the truck you'll do well can choose one of the
 * `truck_generic_*` types if outside North America.
 *
 * ## Truck fuels
 *
 * Suffixes such as `_petrol`, `_cng`, `_lpg`, `_lng`, `_bio_lng` indicate the vehicle uses a specific fuel.
 * When no fuel is specified, assume diesel.
 *
 * ## Truck load characteristics
 *
 * Suffixes such as `_light_load`, `_heavy_load`, `_container` indicate the vehicle's load characteristics.
 * When not specified, assume average/mixed load.
 *
 * # Rail transport
 *
 * You can explicitly request a US emission factor (`diesel_freight_train_us_average`)
 * or a European one (`diesel_freight_train_eu_...`).
 *
 * There are multiple European emission factors for different load characteristics or different traction.
 * When load characteristics or traction aren't known use `diesel_freight_train_eu_average`.
 *
 * For `diesel_freight_train_eu_truck_and_trailer` and
 * `diesel_freight_train_eu_truck_trailer_only` the shipment size refers to the net load
 * within the truck.
 *
 * # Air transport
 *
 * Lune supports two types of aircraft:
 * * `cargo_plane` - freighter
 * * `passenger_plane` - belly freight
 * * `plane` - unknown
 *
 * `plane` uses a weighted average of cargo and passenger planes.
